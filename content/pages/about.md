I'm Victor Vrantchan, a sysadmin that can code. I write [Go](https://golang.org/) and enjoy using, creating and contirbuting to open source projects.  
I build systems with an [SRE](https://landing.google.com/sre/) mindset, following practices like [infrastructure as code](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/InfrastructureAsCode.html), [configuration management](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConfigurationSynchronization.html), [continuous delivery](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html), testing and [instrumentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/instrumentation/). 
I have experience applying the above concepts in a variety of environments, ranging from managing a large fleet of Mac laptops in EDU, to deploying backend services on public Cloud infrastructure.
